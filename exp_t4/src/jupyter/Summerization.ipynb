      "There does not appear to be any explicit exceptions to this rule stated in the text. However, it could be inferred that the family court has discretion to determine whether a guardianship is necessary and appropriate in each individual case, taking into account all relevant factors and circumstances. Additionally, it is possible that there may be other legal provisions or limitations that could affect the application of this rule in specific situations.\n",
      "Main Premise: A person who is subject to a decision for commencement of guardianship becomes an adult ward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "There doesn't appear to be any explicit exception mentioned in the given sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "The main premise states that when a decision is made to initiate guardianship for someone, that individual becomes an \"adult ward.\" This means they are now under the legal supervision and protection of an adult guardian. The sentence does not mention any conditions or circumstances under which this rule may not apply. Therefore, we can assume that it generally applies to all individuals who become subject to a guardianship decision.\n",
      "The main premise of the article is that a juridical act performed by an adult ward is voidable. This means that any legal action taken by an adult who has been declared legally incompetent (an \"adult ward\") can be annulled or canceled by a court.\n",
      "However, there is an exception to this rule. The exception states that the voidability of a juridical act performed by an adult ward does not apply to the purchase of daily necessities or to any other act involved in day-to-day life. This means that an adult ward can still engage in routine transactions, such as buying groceries or paying bills, without fear that these actions will later be challenged in court.\n",
      "Overall, the structure of the article is designed to balance the need to protect the interests of vulnerable adults with the desire to allow them to maintain some level of autonomy and independence in their daily lives.\n",
      "The structure of this article can be broken down as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise: If the grounds prescribed in Article 7 cease to exist, the family court must rescind the decision for the commencement of guardianship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 1: The request for rescission must come from one of the following individuals: the person in question, their spouse, their relative within the fourth degree of kinship, the guardian, the guardian's supervisor, or a public prosecutor.\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "The family court may decide to commence a curatorship in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is extremely inadequate due to a mental disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 1:\n",
      "This decision can only be made upon the request of certain individuals such as the person in question, their spouse, their relative within the fourth degree of kinship, the guardian, the guardian's supervisor, the assistant, the assistant's supervisor, or a public prosecutor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 2:\n",
      "However, this decision cannot be made for a person in respect of whom a cause set forth in Article 7 exists. This exception implies that there might be specific circumstances under which the court cannot initiate a curatorship even if the person meets the criteria of having an extreme lack of capacity to appreciate their own situation due to a mental disorder. It is necessary to refer to Article 7 to understand what these specific circumstances are.\n",
      "The main premise of this article is that when a decision is made to commence curatorship for an individual, that person becomes a person under curatorship and a curator is appointed for them.\n",
      "There does not appear to be any explicit exceptions to this rule stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that there may be certain circumstances or situations where this rule would not apply, such as if the individual is already under another form of legal guardianship or if they are deemed competent to manage their own affairs by a court. Additionally, the specific laws and regulations governing curatorship in different jurisdictions may include additional exceptions or qualifications to this general principle.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 13 is that a person under curatorship must obtain the consent of the curator in order to perform certain acts listed in paragraph (1). These acts include receiving or using property producing civil fruit, borrowing money or guaranteeing an obligation, performing an act with the purpose of acquiring or losing any right regarding immovables or other significant property, and so on.\n",
      "There is one exception to this general rule, which is stated in the proviso of Article 9. This exception allows a person under curatorship to perform certain acts related to managing their own property without the curator's consent.\n",
      "Paragraph (2) provides an additional exception, allowing the family court to decide that the person under curatorship must also obtain the curator's consent before performing an act other than those listed in paragraph (1), if requested by the person under curatorship or the curator's supervisor.\n",
      "If the curator does not consent to an act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent, paragraph (3) allows the family court to grant permission that operates in lieu of the curator's consent at the request of the person under curatorship, if it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship.\n",
      "Finally, paragraph (4) specifies that an act performed by the person under curatorship without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it is voidable, meaning that it can be challenged and declared invalid.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 14 is that if the grounds for commencing curatorship no longer exist, the family court must rescind its decision upon the request of certain individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 1: The request to rescind the decision can only be made by specific individuals such as the person in question, their spouse, relatives up to the fourth degree of kinship, guardians of minors, supervisors of guardians, curators, supervisors of curators, or public prosecutors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 2: Paragraph (2) of the preceding article refers to a decision that may have been made regarding the appointment of a curator or the establishment of a trust to manage the assets of the person in question. Therefore, the request to rescind this decision can only be made with regard to all or part of this decision. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the structure of Article 14 consists of a main premise and two exceptions that specify who can make a request to rescind a decision to commence curatorship and what types of decisions can be rescinded.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 15 (1) is that the family court can decide to commence assistance for a person with a mental disorder who lacks the capacity to understand their own situation. This decision can be made at the request of certain individuals, including the person in question, their spouse, relatives up to the fourth degree of kinship, guardians, supervisors of guardians, curators, supervisors of curators, or public prosecutors.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is an exception to this rule in Article 15 (1), which states that this does not apply to a person with respect to whom there are grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11. These articles relate to cases where a person has committed a crime or acted in a way that harms themselves or others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Article 15 (2) specifies that the issuance of a decision for commencement of assistance at the request of someone other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Article 15 (3) states that a decision for commencement of assistance must be made concurrently with a decision referred to in Article 17, paragraph (1) or a decision referred to in Article 876-9, paragraph (1). These decisions relate to the appointment of a legal representative or guardian for the person in question.\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "\n",
      "A person who is subject to a decision for commencement of assistance becomes a person under assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no explicit exception mentioned in this rule. However, it can be inferred that if a person is no longer subject to a decision for commencement of assistance or if their status changes for any reason, they would no longer be considered a person under assistance.\n",

      "Sub-rule:\n",
      "\n",
      "An assistant is appointed for the person under assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "\n",
      "The rule does not specify any exceptions to the appointment of an assistant. Therefore, it can be assumed that an assistant must always be appointed for a person under assistance unless there are exceptional circumstances that prevent this from happening.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 17 is that the family court can require a person who is receiving assistance to obtain the consent of their assistant in order to perform certain legal acts. The exceptions to this rule are outlined in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4).\n",
      "Paragraph (2) states that if the person seeking to have the family court make a decision requiring the assistant's consent is not the person receiving assistance, then they must first obtain the consent of the person receiving assistance.\n",
      "Paragraph (3) provides an exception to the requirement for the assistant's consent. If the assistant does not give consent to an act that the person receiving assistance needs to perform, but it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person receiving assistance, the family court can grant permission for the act to be performed instead of the assistant's consent.\n",
      "Finally, paragraph (4) establishes that if the person receiving assistance performs an act without obtaining the assistant's consent or permission from the family court, the act is voidable. This means that it can be challenged or overturned later on if it is determined that it was not in the best interests of the person receiving assistance.\n",
      "The article describes the conditions under which the family court can rescind a decision for commencement of assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "If the grounds for assistance prescribed in Article 15, paragraph (1) cease to exist, the family court must rescind the decision for commencement of assistance upon the request of certain individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception to Main Premise (Paragraph 2):\n",
      "At the request of a person mentioned in Paragraph 1, the family court may rescind only part of the decision referred to in paragraph (1) of the previous article if the grounds for assistance have not completely ceased to exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception to Exception (Paragraph 3):\n",
      "If rescinding the entire decision referred to in paragraph (1) of the previous article and the decision referred to in Article 876-9, paragraph (1), the family court must rescind the decision for commencement of assistance even if it means rescinding only part of the original decision.\n",
      "The structure of this passage can be broken down as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "- If the family court decides to commence a guardianship and the person in question is a person under curatorship or a person under assistance, it must rescind the decision for commencement of the curatorship or assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 1:\n",
      "- This applies mutatis mutandis (i.e., with necessary changes) if the court decides to commence a curatorship and the person in question is an adult ward or a person under assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 2:\n",
      "- This also applies mutatis mutandis if the court decides to commence assistance and the person in question is an adult ward or a person under curatorship.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the main premise states that when the family court decides to establish a guardianship for someone who is already under a curatorship or assistance, they must revoke the previous decision regarding the curatorship or assistance. The two exceptions expand this rule to cover situations where the court decides to establish a curatorship for someone who is an adult ward or already under assistance, and vice versa.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 20 is that when a person with qualified legal capacity gains full legal capacity, the other party to their dealings may demand that the person give a definite answer within a specified period of time about whether they will ratify an act that they may rescind. If the person fails to give a definite answer within that period of time, they are deemed to have ratified the act.\n",
      "There are several exceptions to this rule:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Paragraph (2) states that if the other party lodges a demand with the legal representative, curator, or assistant of the person with qualified legal capacity before they gain full legal capacity and the representative, curator, or assistant fails to give a definite answer within the fixed period of time, the person is deemed to have ratified the act.\n",
      "  * Paragraph (3) provides that if a person does not complete any special formalities required for an act within the period of time set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2), they are deemed to have rescinded the act.\n",
      "  * Paragraph (4) allows the other party to dealings involving a person with qualified legal capacity to demand that a person under curatorship or a person under assistance get the curator or assistant to ratify an act within the fixed period referred to in paragraph (1). If the person under curatorship or assistance does not send notice within that period indicating that they have gotten the curator or assistant to ratify the act, they are deemed to have rescinded it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these rules aim to provide clarity and certainty about the status of acts involving persons with qualified legal capacity who later gain full legal capacity, while taking into account various situations where additional steps may be necessary to ensure that the act is properly validated or rescinded.\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "If a person with qualified legal capacity uses fraudulent means to induce another person to believe that the person is a person with legal capacity to act, then that person may not rescind the act in question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "There is no explicit exception provided in this article.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "The main premise of Article 21 states that if a person with qualified legal capacity (i.e., someone who has the ability to understand and make decisions about their own legal rights and responsibilities) uses deceitful tactics to convince another individual that they have the legal authority to perform certain actions, then the person who was deceived cannot undo or rescind the action in question. \n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, if someone tricks you into believing that they can legally do something, and as a result, you enter into an agreement or take some other action that you otherwise wouldn't have taken, then you are generally bound by that decision even if it turns out that the person who tricked you didn't actually have the legal authority to do what they claimed. \n",
      "\n",
      "This rule helps to promote trust and stability in legal transactions by ensuring that people can rely on the representations made by others, even if those representations turn out to be false. However, it's worth noting that there may be situations where exceptions to this rule could apply, such as in cases where the deception was particularly egregious or where the person who was deceived had no reasonable way of knowing that they were being misled. However, these types of exceptions are not explicitly outlined in Article 21 itself.\n",
      "The given statement can be broken down into two parts:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "\"A person's principal place of daily activity is that person's domicile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that a person's primary residence or the place where they spend most of their time is considered to be their domicile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "There is no explicit exception mentioned in this statement. However, there may be certain circumstances where an individual's domicile may not be the same as their principal place of daily activity. For example, if someone works in a different city during the week and returns to their hometown on weekends, their principal place of daily activity would be the city where they work, but their domicile would be their hometown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the statement presents a general principle that a person's domicile is typically the same as their principal place of daily activity, while acknowledging that there may be exceptions to this rule depending on individual circumstances.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 23 is that a person's domicile can be determined based on their residence.\n",
      "The first exception states that if a person's domicile is unknown, then their residence will be considered their domicile.\n",
      "The second exception applies to individuals who do not have a domicile in Japan. In this case, their residence will also be considered their domicile, unless the law of their domicile requires its application.\n",
      "It is important to note that the second exception only applies to individuals who are not Japanese nationals, as Japanese nationals are always considered to have a domicile in Japan.\n",
      "In summary, the main premise of Article 23 is that a person's domicile can be determined by their residence, but exceptions may apply depending on whether the person's domicile is unknown or if they are a non-Japanese national.\n",
      "The main premise of the rule stated in Article 24 is that if a person selects a temporary address for an act, that temporary address will be considered their domicile for the purposes of that particular act.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there may be exceptions to this rule. The phrase \"as far as that act is concerned\" implies that the temporary address may not be considered the person's domicile for other purposes or acts beyond the specific one for which it was chosen.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if a person temporarily moves to a new city for work and uses that address on their employment contract, that address would be considered their domicile for the purposes of that employment contract. However, if they were then involved in a legal dispute unrelated to their employment, their permanent residence may still be considered their domicile for the purposes of that dispute. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, while the temporary address can be deemed the domicile for a specific act, its status as such may be limited to that particular act and not apply more broadly.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 25(1) is that when an absentee (a person who has left their domicile or residence) does not appoint an administrator for their property, the family court can order necessary dispositions regarding the administration of that property upon the request of an interested person or a public prosecutor. \n",
      "\n",
      "The exception to this rule is stated in Article 25(2), which provides that if an absentee appoints an administrator after an order has been issued by the family court under the provisions of paragraph (1), the family court must rescind that order at the request of the administrator, an interested person, or a public prosecutor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, while the family court has the authority to order dispositions related to the administration of an absentee's property in the absence of an administrator, this authority can be revoked if the absentee subsequently appoints an administrator.\n",
      "Main Premise: The family court can replace an administrator appointed by an absentee if it's unclear whether the absentee is dead or alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "1. Request by interested person: The replacement of the administrator can only be done if an interested person requests it.\n",
      "2. Request by public prosecutor: The replacement of the administrator can also be done if a public prosecutor requests it.\n",
      "The article outlines the responsibilities of an administrator appointed by the family court to manage the property of an absentee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The administrator appointed by the family court must prepare a list of the property they will administer.\n",
      "2. Expenses incurred by the administrator are paid from the absentee's property.\n",
      "3. The family court can require the administrator to take additional actions to protect the absentee's property as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. When the absentee's生死不明, and either an interested person or a public prosecutor requests it, the family court can order the administrator appointed by the absentee to prepare the property list mentioned in the first exception.\n",
      "Main Premise: An administrator can perform an act exceeding their authority under Article 103 only with the permission of the family court.\n",
      "Exception 1: This rule also applies when it is unclear whether the absentee (the person whose affairs the administrator is managing) is dead or alive, and the administrator needs to perform an act exceeding their authority as established by the absentee.\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The family court has the authority to require an administrator to provide reasonable security regarding the management and return of the property.\n",
      "* The family court can grant reasonable remuneration to the administrator from the absentee's property, taking into account the relationship between the administrator and absentee, as well as other relevant circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception for Main Premise:\n",
      "\n",
      "None explicitly mentioned in the given text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception for Exception:\n",
      "\n",
      "None explicitly mentioned in the given text.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 30 is that if it has been unclear for a certain period of time whether an absentee is dead or alive, the family court may issue a declaration of disappearance upon the request of an interested person.\n",
      "In Paragraph (1), the main premise applies if it has been unclear for seven years whether an absentee is dead or alive. In this case, the family court may issue a declaration of disappearance at the request of an interested person.\n",
      "In Paragraph (2), the main premise also applies if it has been unclear whether a person who has entered a war zone, was aboard a vessel that has sunk, or was otherwise exposed to a danger likely to result in a person's death is dead or alive. However, in this case, the time frame for uncertainty is shorter, lasting only one year after the war has ended, the vessel sank, or such other danger has passed.\n",
      "There are no explicit exceptions to these rules mentioned in Article 30.\n",
      "The main premise of this legal provision is that a person who has been declared missing under certain circumstances is considered to have died after a specific period of time has elapsed or when a particular danger has passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two separate scenarios covered by this provision:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Declaration of disappearance under paragraph (1): If a person has disappeared and there is reason to believe that they may be dead, a court can declare them missing. In this case, the person is deemed to have died when the period of time specified in the declaration has ended. There is no exception to this rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Declaration of disappearance under paragraph (2): If a person has disappeared in a dangerous situation, such as a natural disaster or armed conflict, a court can declare them missing. In this case, the person is deemed to have died when the danger that caused their disappearance has passed. There is no exception to this rule either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the structure of this provision consists of two main premises, each with its own set of circumstances and without any exceptions.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 32 is that if there is proof that a missing person is alive or that they died at a different time than previously declared, the family court can rescind the declaration of their disappearance upon request of the missing person or an interested party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception: The rescission of the declaration of disappearance does not affect the validity of any acts performed in good faith after the declaration of disappearance but before the rescission.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second part of the article states that a person who has acquired property due to the declaration of disappearance loses those rights upon the rescission of the declaration. However, they are only obligated to return the property to the extent that they were enriched by it. This means that if they spent some of the inherited money, they would only have to return what was left over, and not the full amount originally inherited.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 32-2 is that when multiple people die and it's uncertain whether any of them survived the others, the legal assumption is made that they all died simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "There doesn't appear to be an explicit exception within this particular clause. The rule applies universally in situations where there is uncertainty about the sequence of deaths. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's worth noting that other factors or evidence might challenge this presumption in specific cases. For example, if there is forensic evidence or eyewitness testimony suggesting a clear sequence of events, this could potentially override the general presumption. But such exceptions would likely depend on the specifics of individual cases and the strength of the counter-evidence presented.\n",
      "The main premise of this statement is that a juridical person can only be formed in accordance with the provisions of either this Code or other applicable laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no explicit exception mentioned in this rule. Therefore, it can be inferred that there are no circumstances under which a juridical person can be formed outside of the provisions of this Code or other applicable laws. \n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, any attempt to form a juridical person without following the prescribed legal procedures would be considered invalid and may result in legal consequences.\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A not-for-profit association or foundation can be established as a juridical person.\n",
      "2. The establishment requires permission from the competent government agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The type of activities the association or foundation can engage in: academic activities, art, charity, worship, religion, or any other matter of public interest.\n",
      "2. There might be additional requirements or restrictions imposed by the competent government agency, which are not explicitly mentioned in the given statement.\n",
      "The main premise of this rule is that non-incorporated associations and foundations must not use certain words or phrases in their names.\n",
      "The exception to this rule is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that there may be situations where a non-incorporated association or foundation is allowed to use these words or phrases in their names if they have received special permission from the relevant authorities. However, such exceptions would likely be limited and subject to strict regulations and requirements.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 36(1) is that the formation of foreign juridical persons is generally not permitted in Japan, except for states, administrative divisions of states, and commercial companies. The exception to this rule is when the formation of a foreign juridical person is permitted under the provisions of a law or treaty.\n",
      "In other words, the general rule is that foreign juridical persons cannot be formed in Japan, but there may be specific instances where they can be formed if they meet certain criteria set out in Japanese laws or treaties.\n",
      "Article 36(2) then goes on to state that, if a foreign juridical person is permitted to be formed in Japan under the exception outlined in paragraph (1), it will possess the same private rights as a domestic juridical person of the same kind. However, this provision also includes an exception, stating that this does not apply to rights that foreign nationals are not entitled to enjoy or to any rights that have special provisions in a law or treaty.\n",
      "Therefore, while foreign juridical persons may be able to form in Japan under certain circumstances, their rights and privileges may be limited compared to those of domestic juridical persons.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 37 is that certain events related to incorporated associations must be registered with the relevant authorities within specific time frames.\n",
      "Paragraph (1) sets out the information that must be included in the articles of incorporation of an incorporated association.\n",
      "Paragraph (2) requires that any changes to the information listed in Paragraph (1) must be registered within three weeks.\n",
      "Paragraphs (3) and (4) deal with situations where an order of provisional disposition is issued suspending the execution of duties by a representative or appointing a person to execute duties in place of a representative. These paragraphs require that such orders must be registered, and specify the time frame within which they must be registered.\n",
      "Paragraph (5) provides an exception to the general requirement that foreign corporations must be registered in Japan. Specifically, if a foreign corporation establishes an office in Japan for the first time, a third party may decline to recognize the corporation's formation until it has been registered in the locality of that office.\n",
      "Paragraph (6) deals with situations where a foreign corporation relocates its office within Japan. This paragraph requires that the corporation must register its relocation within three weeks in the former locality and register the information listed in Paragraph (1) within four weeks in the new locality.\n",
      "Paragraph (7) provides an exception to the requirements of Paragraph (6). Specifically, if a foreign corporation relocates its office within the jurisdictional district of the same registry office, it is sufficient for it to register its relocation.\n",
      "Finally, Paragraph (8) specifies that representatives of foreign juridical persons who fail to complete the registration required under this Article are subject to a civil fine of up to 500,000 yen.\n",
      "The given statement is a definition of the term \"things\" as used in a specific code or legal document. It states that the term refers to tangible objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise: The term \"things\" refers to tangible objects.\n",
      "Exception: There is no explicit exception mentioned in the statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The statement does not provide any exceptions to the definition of \"things.\" Therefore, it can be inferred that anything that is not a tangible object would not fall under the category of \"things\" as defined by the code. This may include intangible assets such as intellectual property, digital assets, or services.\n",
      "The two rules stated in Article 86 can be analyzed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise: \n",
      "Land and any fixtures thereto are immovables.\n",
      "\n",
      "This rule establishes that land and anything permanently attached to it (fixtures) are considered immovable property. This includes buildings, trees, crops, and any other permanent structures or improvements on the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "Things other than immovables are movables.\n",
      "\n",
      "This exception clarifies that not everything is considered an immovable property. It specifies that things other than land and fixtures are considered movable property. Examples of movable property include furniture, vehicles, jewelry, and other personal possessions that are not permanently attached to the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Article 86 provides a clear definition of what constitutes immovable property and distinguishes it from movable property. The main premise sets forth the general rule that land and fixtures are immovables, while the exception carves out certain exceptions to this rule by specifying that things other than immovables are movables.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 87 is that when an owner attaches a second thing they own to the first thing for its ordinary use, the attached item becomes an appurtenance.\n",
      "There is no explicit exception mentioned in this rule. However, it can be inferred that there may be instances where an attachment may not qualify as an appurtenance if it does not serve the ordinary use of the principal thing or if it is intended to be detached and used separately.\n",
      "The second part of the rule states that an appurtenance is disposed of along with the principal thing when it is sold or transferred. This means that the buyer or recipient of the principal thing automatically acquires ownership of the appurtenance as well. Again, there is no explicit exception mentioned in this rule, but it can be assumed that there may be cases where an appurtenance may be separated from the principal thing and sold or transferred separately, such as in the case of a removable accessory or component.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 88 is that products obtained from the intended use of a thing are considered its natural fruits. This means that if you use something for its intended purpose, any resulting products are considered to be part of that thing's natural output.\n",
      "There is no explicit exception provided in this part of the rule.\n",
      "The second part of Article 88 states that money and other items that can be obtained in exchange for the use of something are considered to be its civil fruits. In other words, if you use something in a way that generates income or other financial benefits, those gains are considered to be separate from the natural fruits of the thing itself.\n",
      "Again, there is no explicit exception provided in this part of the rule.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 89 is that ownership of natural and civil fruits can be acquired through certain actions or rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 1: Natural Fruits - Ownership of natural fruits, such as crops or fruit from trees, is acquired by the person who is entitled to obtain them when they are separated from the original thing. This means that if someone has the legal right to harvest fruit from a tree, for example, they become the owner of that fruit once it is picked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 2: Civil Fruits - Ownership of civil fruits, which include income generated from property, is acquired by the person in proportion to the duration of their right to obtain them. This means that if someone owns a rental property, for example, they would only own a portion of the rent collected during the time period in which they were legally entitled to receive it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Article 89 establishes clear rules for how ownership of fruits can be acquired, while also providing exceptions to those rules based on specific circumstances.\n",
      "Main Premise: A juridical act that is against public policy is void.\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * None specified in the given statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "The main premise states that any legal action or agreement (juridical act) that goes against public policy is considered invalid and unenforceable (void). This means that if a contract, for example, violates laws or ethical standards that are meant to protect the greater good, it cannot be legally recognized.\n",
      "There is no exception listed in the statement, which suggests that there are no situations where a juridical act against public policy would be considered valid. However, it's worth noting that different jurisdictions may have varying interpretations of what constitutes public policy, and some may allow for exceptions in certain circumstances.\n",
      "The structure of Article 91 can be broken down as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise: If a party to a juridical act manifests an intention that is inconsistent with the provisions of laws and regulations that are not related to public policy, that intention prevails.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception: However, if the intention is inconsistent with laws and regulations related to public policy, then the provision of those laws and regulations will prevail over the party's intention.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the article states that in most cases, the intention of a party in a legal agreement will take precedence over any conflicting laws or regulations, unless those laws and regulations are related to public policy. This means that parties in a legal agreement have some degree of freedom to shape their own contractual arrangements, but this freedom is limited by the need to protect important societal values and interests.\n",
      "The given statement consists of two parts - a main premise and an exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise: \n",
      "If a custom is inconsistent with the provisions of laws and regulations that are not related to public policy, and if it is found that the party to the juridical act has the intention to abide by that custom, then that custom prevails.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that in case there is a conflict between a custom and laws or regulations that do not relate to public policy, and if the parties involved intended to follow the custom, then the custom will be given precedence over the law or regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "However, this rule applies only when the custom does not contradict public policy. In other words, if the custom goes against public policy, then it cannot prevail over the law or regulation, regardless of whether the parties intended to follow the custom or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the exception to the main premise is that customs that go against public policy cannot be given precedence over laws and regulations, even if the parties intended to follow them.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 93 (1) states that the validity of a manifestation of intention is not affected by the fact that the person making it knows that it does not reflect their true intention. This means that even if someone makes a statement or takes an action with the knowledge that it does not truly represent their desires or beliefs, that statement or action can still be considered valid and legally binding.\n",
      "However, there is an exception to this rule provided in the proviso to paragraph (1). According to this exception, if the other party to the transaction knew or should have known that the manifestation of intention was not the true intention of the person making it, then the manifestation is void. In other words, if one party had reason to believe that the other party's statement or action did not accurately reflect their true intentions, and they proceeded with the transaction anyway, the manifestation of intention would not be legally enforceable.\n",
      "Paragraph (2) further clarifies that the nullity of a manifestation of intention under the proviso to paragraph (1) cannot be invoked against a third party who acted in good faith. This means that if a third party enters into a transaction based on a manifestation of intention that is later found to be invalid due to the exception in paragraph (1), they will still be bound by the terms of the transaction as long as they had no reason to suspect that the manifestation was not genuine. In essence, this provision aims to protect innocent third parties from being caught up in disputes between the original parties to the transaction.\n",
      "The structure of Article 94 can be analyzed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "\"A false manifestation of intention that a person makes in collusion with another person is void.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This main premise establishes that any expression of intent made by an individual in collaboration with someone else, if it is found to be fake or misleading, will be considered legally invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception to Main Premise:\n",
      "\"The nullity of a manifestation of intention under the provisions of the preceding paragraph may not be duly asserted against a third party in good faith.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This exception provides a safeguard for innocent third parties who have relied on the false manifestation of intention in good faith. It means that even though the false manifestation of intention is void, it cannot be declared invalid retroactively against an unsuspecting and honest third party who has acted upon it. In other words, a third party who was not involved in the collusion and had no knowledge of the falsity of the intention will not be negatively affected by the nullification of the manifestation of intention.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 95 of Japanese Civil Code is that a manifestation of intention can be declared voidable or rescinded if it is based on a material mistake. This includes mistakes regarding the intention of the person making the manifestation or misunderstandings about the circumstances upon which the juridical act is based.\n",
      "There are two exceptions to this general rule:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. Exception for lack of intention: Under paragraph (1)(i), a manifestation of intention is voidable if the person lacked the intention corresponding to their manifestation. However, this exception does not apply if the mistake was due to gross negligence on the part of the person making the manifestation.\n",
      "  2. Exception for misunderstanding: Under paragraph (1)(ii), a manifestation of intention is rescindable if the person had an understanding that did not correspond to the truth about the circumstances upon which the juridical act was based. However, this exception applies only if it was indicated that the circumstances were being taken as the basis for the juridical act.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph (3) further limits the application of the exception for misunderstanding by stating that the person making the manifestation cannot rescind it if they were grossly negligent, unless the other party also made the same mistake or knew about the mistake but failed to inform the person making the manifestation.\n",
      "Finally, paragraph (4) clarifies that the right to rescind a manifestation of intention cannot be exercised against a third party who acted in good faith without negligence. This means that even if a manifestation of intention is rescindable or voidable, it will not affect the rights of innocent third parties who have relied on it.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 96 is that a manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress is voidable. This means that a person who has been subjected to fraud or duress can choose to invalidate their manifestation of intention, which may have legal consequences.\n",
      "The first exception to this rule is stated in paragraph (2), which deals with situations where a third party commits a fraud that induces a first party to make a manifestation of intention to a second party. In such cases, the manifestation of intention is only voidable if the second party knew or could have known about the fraud committed by the third party. This provision aims to protect innocent parties from being held responsible for the fraudulent actions of others.\n",
      "The second exception to the rule is outlined in paragraph (3), which concerns the situation where a manifestation of intention has been induced by fraud and a third party has acted in good faith without negligence. In such cases, the rescission of the manifestation of intention cannot be enforced against the third party, even if they were aware of the fraud. This provision aims to prevent innocent parties from suffering adverse consequences due to the fraudulent actions of others.\n",
      "Overall, Article 96 seeks to balance the need to protect individuals from the negative effects of fraud or duress while ensuring that innocent parties are not unjustly penalized for the wrongdoing of others.\n",
      "Main Premise: A manifestation of intention becomes effective when notice thereof reaches the other party.\n",
      "Exception 1: If the other party prevents notice of a manifestation of intention from reaching them without a legitimate reason, the notice is deemed to have reached that party at the time it would have normally reached them.\n",
      "Exception 2: The effect of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it dies, loses mental capacity, or becomes subject to restrictions on their legal capacity to act after having sent the notice.\n",
      "The first exception clarifies that the effectiveness of a manifestation of intention is not solely dependent on the actual receipt of notice by the other party. Instead, it considers situations where the other party might intentionally prevent the notice from being received without a valid reason. In such cases, the notice is still considered as effectively communicated at the time it would have typically been received, ensuring that the person making the manifestation cannot evade its consequences.\n",
      "The second exception reinforces the principle that the manifestation of intention remains effective regardless of any subsequent changes in the personal circumstances of the person who made it. This means that the death, loss of mental capacity, or restrictions on legal capacity of the individual sending the notice do not negate the effects of the manifestation of intention, and the notice will continue to be binding on both parties involved.\n",
      "The article outlines the rules for making a manifestation of intention by means of public notice. The main premise of the rule is that a manifestation of intention can be made through public notice if the person making it cannot determine the identity or location of the other party.\n",
      "Exception 1: The second paragraph provides an exception to the method of public notice, allowing the court to order that a notice be posted in the posting area of a city office, ward office, town hall, or equivalent facility instead of publishing it in the Official Gazette if it deems it appropriate.\n",
      "Exception 2: The third paragraph includes an exception to the timing of the manifestation of intention reaching the other party. If the person making the manifestation of intention was negligent in not ascertaining the other party or their whereabouts, the effect of the manifestation of intention reaching the other party does not arise, even after the required time has passed.\n",
      "Exception 3: The fourth paragraph specifies different jurisdictions for public notice procedures depending on whether the person making the manifestation of intention cannot determine the identity or location of the other party. If the person making the manifestation of intention cannot determine the identity of the other party, the procedures fall under the jurisdiction of the summary court in the locality where they are domiciled. If the person making the manifestation of intention cannot determine the location of the other party, the procedures fall under the jurisdiction of the summary court in the locality of the other party's last known domicile.\n",
      "Finally, the fifth paragraph requires the person making a manifestation of intention to prepay the expenses associated with the public notice.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 98-2 is that a person cannot assert a manifestation of intention against another party if that other party lacked mental capacity or was a minor or an adult ward at the time of receiving it.\n",
      "The exception to this rule is that if either the legal representative of the other party or the other party themselves (after their mental capacity has been restored or they have become a person with capacity to act) learn of the manifestation of intention, then the assertion can be made.\n",
      "In summary, the article states that a manifestation of intention cannot be asserted against someone who lacked mental capacity or was a minor/adult ward at the time of receiving it, unless their legal representative or the individual themselves (once they have regained capacity) becomes aware of the intention.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 99 is that manifestations of intention made by an agent on behalf of their principal within the scope of their authority bind the principal directly. In other words, if an agent communicates their intention to enter into a contract or take some other legal action on behalf of their principal, the principal is bound by that intention as if they had communicated it themselves.\n",
      "There is no explicit exception to this rule in the first paragraph of Article 99.\n",
      "The second paragraph of Article 99 applies mutatis mutandis (i.e., with necessary changes) the same principle to manifestations of intention made by a third party to an agent. This means that if a third party communicates their intention to enter into a contract or take some other legal action with respect to the principal through an agent, the principal is bound by that intention as if they had received it directly from the third party.\n",
      "Again, there is no explicit exception to this rule in the second paragraph of Article 99. However, it is worth noting that the scope of the agent's authority may limit the types of manifestations of intention that can be made on behalf of the principal. For example, if an agent is only authorized to negotiate certain terms of a contract, but not to agree to final terms, then a manifestation of intention by the third party to enter into a contract with those final terms would not bind the principal. Similarly, if an agent is only authorized to receive certain types of communications from a third party, but not others, then a manifestation of intention outside the scope of that authority would not bind the principal.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 100 is that when an agent manifests their intention without indicating that they are acting on behalf of the principal, it is deemed to be an action made on their own account. In other words, if an agent does not disclose their agency relationship with the principal, any manifestation of intent will be considered as being made by the agent personally.\n",
      "However, there is an exception to this rule. If the other party knew or could have known that the agent was acting on behalf of the principal, then the provisions of paragraph (1) of the preceding article would apply mutatis mutandis. This means that the other party cannot claim ignorance of the agency relationship and should have acted accordingly.\n",
      "In summary, the main premise of Article 100 is that manifestations of intent made by an agent without indicating agency relationship are considered personal actions, but this rule is subject to an exception where the other party had knowledge or could have known about the agency relationship.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 101 is that the validity of manifestations of intention between an agent and another party can be influenced by certain factors such as mistake, fraud, duress, or knowledge/negligence of particular circumstances.\n",
      "Exception 1: Subsection (1) specifies that when determining the influence of these factors on the validity of the agent's manifestation of intention, the decision will be based on the perspective of the agent.\n",
      "Exception 2: Subsection (2) states that when assessing the impact of the recipient's knowledge/negligence of particular circumstances on the validity of their manifestation of intention, the decision will be made from the viewpoint of the agent.\n",
      "Exception 3: Subsection (3) stipulates that if an agent performs a specific juridical act on behalf of their principal, the principal cannot claim that the agent was unaware of any particular circumstances that the principal was aware of. This also applies to any circumstances that the principal was unaware of due to their own negligence.\n",
      "The structure of Article 102 can be analyzed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise: An act that a person with qualified legal capacity performs as an agent of another person may not be rescinded on the grounds of qualified legal capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that if someone with qualified legal capacity acts as an agent for another person (i.e., they act on behalf of and with the authority of another person), their actions cannot be undone or reversed solely because of their qualified legal capacity. In other words, the fact that the person has qualified legal capacity cannot be used as a reason to nullify the act they performed as an agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception: This provision does not apply to an act performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as a legal representative of another person with qualified legal capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "This exception states that the main premise does not apply in cases where a person with qualified legal capacity acts as a legal representative for another person with qualified legal capacity. In such cases, the act performed by the legal representative can still be rescinded on the grounds of qualified legal capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Article 102 establishes that acts performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as an agent for another person cannot be rescinded based on their qualified legal capacity, except when the person is acting as a legal representative for another person with qualified legal capacity.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 103 is that an agent who has no specifically defined authority has limited authority to act on behalf of their principal.\n",
      "The exception to this main premise is that the agent may perform certain acts related to preserving or utilizing the thing or right that is the subject matter of the agency, as long as these acts do not fundamentally alter the nature of the thing or right.\n",
      "In other words, the agent is only authorized to perform acts that are necessary for maintaining the status quo or making use of the thing or right in a way that is consistent with its intended purpose. They cannot take actions that would fundamentally change the character or essence of the thing or right.\n",
      "Overall, this provision aims to strike a balance between allowing agents to carry out necessary tasks on behalf of their principals while also ensuring that they do not exceed their authority and make decisions that could have significant consequences for the principal.\n",
      "Main Premise: An agent appointed by mandate may not appoint a subagent.\n",
      "Exception 1: The authorization of the principal is obtained.\n",
      "Exception 2: There is a compelling reason to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main premise states that an agent who has been given authority through a mandate cannot appoint another person as their subagent. This means that the agent is responsible for carrying out the tasks assigned to them and cannot delegate these responsibilities to someone else without permission from the principal.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are two exceptions to this rule. The first exception allows the agent to appoint a subagent if they have received authorization from the principal. If the principal gives their consent, the agent can pass on some of their responsibilities to a subagent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second exception applies in situations where there is a compelling reason for the agent to appoint a subagent. This might include cases where the agent is unable to complete the tasks themselves due to illness, injury, or other unforeseen circumstances. In such cases, the agent may need to appoint a subagent to ensure that the work is completed on time and to the required standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the rule and its exceptions aim to balance the need for agents to carry out their duties effectively with the rights of principals to control how their mandates are executed. By allowing exceptions in certain circumstances, the rule ensures that agents can act flexibly while still respecting the limits of their authority.\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "\n",
      "A legal representative can appoint a subagent on their own responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a compelling reason, the legal representative is only liable to the principal for the appointment and supervision of the subagent.\n",
      "\n",
      "To analyze this structure, we can break down the main premise and exception into simpler components:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "1. A legal representative has the authority to appoint a subagent.\n",
      "2. The legal representative assumes responsibility for the appointment of the subagent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "1. There may be situations where there is a compelling reason to appoint a subagent.\n",
      "2. In these circumstances, the legal representative's liability to the principal is limited to the appointment and supervision of the subagent, rather than being responsible for all actions or omissions of the subagent.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 106 is that a subagent represents the principal (the person who appointed the agent) with respect to acts within the scope of the authority thereof. This means that when a subagent performs tasks on behalf of the principal, they act as if they were the principal themselves.\n",
      "Exception: However, this general rule is subject to an exception stated in paragraph (2). According to this provision, a subagent has the same rights and obligations as an agent in relation to the principal and third parties within the scope of that subagent's authority. This means that while a subagent generally acts on behalf of the principal, they also have their own rights and responsibilities that they must fulfill.\n",
      "For example, suppose a company hires an agent to negotiate a contract with another business. The agent then hires a subagent to assist them in negotiating the terms of the contract. In this case, the subagent would be representing the company in their negotiations with the other business. However, the subagent would also have their own rights and obligations in relation to the company and the other business. For instance, they might be entitled to payment for their services or required to keep certain information confidential.\n",
      "The structure of Article 107 can be analyzed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "If an agent performs an act that falls within the scope of that agent's authority to represent for the purpose of benefiting the agent's own interests or the interests of a third party, and the other party knew of or could have ascertained that purpose, that act is deemed to be an act performed by a person without authority to represent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "N/A\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, the main premise outlines a scenario in which an agent acts within their authority but does so primarily for their own benefit or for the benefit of a third party. This situation would typically raise concerns about the validity of the agent's actions, as they may not be acting in the best interests of the principal (the person represented by the agent). The article states that if the other party (通常是与代理人互动的人) was aware of or could have reasonably determined the agent's true intentions, then the act will be considered as if it were performed by someone without proper authorization.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no explicit exception provided in Article 107. However, it's important to note that the applicability of this provision depends on specific circumstances, such as the nature of the relationship between the agent and the principal, the level of knowledge or ignorance of the other party, and any relevant laws or regulations that might modify the general principle established in the article.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 108(1) is that when a person acts as an agent of both parties for the same juridical act, it is considered as an act performed by someone without representation authority. However, there is an exception to this rule, which states that this provision does not apply if the act is done to fulfill an obligation or if the principal has given prior authorization.\n",
      "\n",
      "In simpler terms, if a person acts on behalf of two parties for the same legal transaction and the interests of the parties conflict, the act will be treated as unauthorized unless the principal has given permission in advance or the act is necessary to meet an existing obligation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second part of the article, Article 108(2), provides another exception to the general rule stated in Article 108(1). It states that if an agent's interests conflict with those of the principal, the act will still be considered unauthorized, unless the principal has given permission in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, under Article 108, any act performed by an agent where there is a conflict of interest between the agent and the principal will generally be regarded as unauthorized, except in cases where the principal has granted prior authorization or the act is required to satisfy an existing obligation.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 109 (1) is that a person who represents to a third party that they have authority to represent another person is liable for any actions taken within the scope of that authority.\n",
      "The exception to this rule is stated in Article 109 (1), which states that this liability does not apply if the third party knew or should have known that the person representing them did not actually have the authority to do so.\n",
      "Article 109 (2) further clarifies that if a person who represents to a third party that they have authority to represent another person is liable for actions taken within the scope of that authority, but the other person goes beyond the scope of their authority, the person making the representation is only liable for those actions if the third party had reasonable grounds to believe that the other person had the authority to take such actions.\n",
      "The structure of this article can be analyzed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Main premise: If an agent performs an act exceeding their authority to represent, and a third party has reasonable grounds for believing that the agent has the authority as an agent, then the provisions of the main clause of paragraph (1) of the preceding article apply mutatis mutandis.\n",
      "  * Exception: There is no explicit exception mentioned in the article.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, the article states that under certain circumstances, the provisions of the previous article will apply to situations where an agent exceeds their authority to represent. Specifically, this will occur when both of the following conditions are met:\n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  1. The agent performs an act that goes beyond their authorized scope of representation.\n",
      "  2. A third party has reasonable grounds for believing that the agent has the authority to perform such an act.\n",
      "\n",
      "If these conditions are met, then the provisions of the main clause of paragraph (1) of the preceding article will apply, with any necessary modifications or adaptations to fit the specific situation at hand.\n",
      "There is no exception to this rule explicitly stated in the article. Therefore, it appears that the provisions of the previous article will always apply in the circumstances described above, without exception.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 111 is that the authority to represent terminates under certain circumstances.\n",
      "Paragraph (1) sets out two exceptions to this general rule:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Death of the principal: This means that if the person who granted the authority to represent them dies, then the authority to represent terminates automatically.\n",
      "  * Death of the agent, or being given an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding or a decision for commencement of guardianship against the agent: This means that if the person who has been authorized to represent another person dies, or if they are declared bankrupt or placed under guardianship, then the authority to represent terminates automatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph (2) states that the authority to represent by mandate terminates under other circumstances, except for those listed in Paragraph (1). This means that there may be other reasons why the authority to represent by mandate terminates, but these are not specified in the text.\n",
      "The structure of Article 112 can be broken down into two main premises with exceptions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise 1: Liability for Acts Within the Scope of Authority to Represent After Extinction\n",
      "Paragraph 1 states that when a person grants authority to represent them to another person, they are liable towards a third party for acts performed within the scope of that authority after it has ceased to exist. However, this liability does not apply if the third party did not know about the extinction of the authority to represent and their lack of knowledge was not due to negligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 1: No Liability if Third Party Did Not Know Due to Negligence\n",
      "As mentioned in Main Premise 1, there is no liability towards the third party if they were negligent in not knowing about the extinction of the authority to represent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise 2: Liability for Acts Beyond the Scope of Authority to Represent\n",
      "Paragraph 2 explains that if a person who granted authority to represent them is liable for acts performed within the scope of that authority after its extinction, they will also be liable for acts performed by the other person beyond the scope of the authority to represent. However, this liability applies only if the third party had reasonable grounds to believe that the other person had authority to represent for the act.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 2: No Liability if Third Party Had No Reasonable Grounds to Believe in Authority to Represent\n",
      "In contrast to Exception 1, there is no liability towards the third party if they did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the other person had authority to represent them for the act performed beyond the scope of the authority.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 113 is that a contract entered into by an agent without proper authority does not bind the principal unless ratified by the principal.\n",
      "The first exception to this rule is that the principal must make their ratification or refusal to ratify known to the other party in order for it to be validly asserted against them. This means that the other party cannot be held to the contract if they were not aware of the principal's decision to ratify or refuse to ratify.\n",
      "The second exception to this rule is that if the other party knew about the ratification or refusal to ratify, then the principal can assert their decision against the other party even if they did not communicate it directly to them. In other words, the other party cannot claim ignorance of the principal's decision if they had knowledge of it.\n",
      "The structure of this article can be analyzed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise: If there is a case referred to in the preceding article, the counterparty may demand a definite answer from the principal on whether they will ratify within a specified reasonable period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception: If the principal fails to give a definite answer within the specified period, the principal is deemed to have refused to ratify.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 115 is that a counterparty can rescind (cancel) a contract that was made by someone who did not have the authority to represent the other party (the principal). This means that if someone signs a contract on behalf of another person without having the proper authorization, the other party can choose to cancel the contract and not be bound by its terms.\n",
      "However, there is an exception to this rule: if the counterparty (the person who entered into the contract with the unauthorized representative) knew at the time of the contract's signing that the representative did not have the authority to act on behalf of the principal, then they cannot rescind the contract. In other words, if the counterparty was aware that the representative was not authorized but still chose to enter into the contract anyway, they cannot later claim that the contract is invalid due to lack of authority.\n",
      "Overall, the purpose of this provision is to protect parties from being bound by contracts that were made by individuals who did not have the proper authority to act on their behalf. However, it also recognizes that in some cases, both parties may be aware that the representative lacks authority but still choose to proceed with the contract, in which case it would not be fair to allow one party to rescind the agreement.\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ratification is retroactive to the time of the conclusion of the contract unless a particular intention is manifested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "\n",
      "This retroactivity may not prejudice the rights of a third party.\n",
      "\n",
      "In simpler terms, the main principle states that when a contract is ratified (formally approved or confirmed), it takes effect from the time the contract was initially agreed upon. However, there's an exception to this rule: if ratifying the contract would harm the rights of an unrelated person (a third party), then the retroactivity cannot be applied in a way that negatively impacts that third party's rights. This ensures that the process of ratification does not unfairly disadvantage those who were not involved in the original agreement.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 117 (1) states that a person who enters into a contract on behalf of another person (the \"agent\") is liable to the counterparty for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage, as chosen by the counterparty, unless the agent can prove their authority to represent or the principal ratifies the contract.\n",
      "The exception to this main premise is outlined in Article 117 (2), which provides three scenarios where the provisions of paragraph 1 do not apply:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * If the counterparty knew that the agent had no authority to represent, then the agent is not liable.\n",
      "  * If the counterparty was negligent in not knowing that the agent had no authority to represent, and the agent did not know themselves to have no authority to represent, then the agent is not liable.\n",
      "  * If the legal capacity to act of the agent was subject to restrictions, then the agent is not liable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the exception to the main premise provides situations where the agent may not be held liable to the counterparty, even if they cannot prove their authority to represent or the principal has not ratified the contract.\n",
      "The main premise of this provision is that the rules governing bilateral juridical acts (Articles 113-117) also apply to unilateral juridical acts, but with certain modifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first exception to this general rule is that the provisions only apply \"mutatis mutandis,\" meaning that they must be adapted to fit the specific circumstances of unilateral juridical acts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second exception concerns cases where the counterparty either agrees for the person holding themselves out as an agent to act without the authority to represent or does not contest the authority to represent of that person. In these situations, the rules governing bilateral juridical acts do not apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third exception involves cases where a person does a unilateral juridical act vis-a-vis a person without authority to represent with the consent of that person. Once again, the rules governing bilateral juridical acts do not apply in these situations.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 119 A is that a void act cannot be made effective through ratification. This means that if an act is invalid or null, then it cannot be ratified to make it legally binding.\n",
      "However, there is an exception to this rule. If a party ratifies an act knowing that it is void, then they are considered to have performed a new act. In other words, their ratification of the void act is treated as a separate action, which may have legal consequences.\n",
      "This exception is important because it ensures that parties cannot use ratification as a way to evade responsibility for their actions. If someone knowingly ratifies a void act, they cannot later claim that they were unaware of its invalidity and should not be held accountable.\n",
      "Overall, Article 119 A establishes a clear principle that void acts cannot be ratified to become effective, while also providing an exception to ensure that parties do not abuse the ratification process.\n",
      "The article can be analyzed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise: Acts that are voidable due to the qualified legal capacity of the person who performed the act or due to mistakes, fraud, or duress may be rescinded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 1: Only the person with qualified legal capacity, their legal representative, successor, or an authorized person can rescind an act that is voidable due to the qualified legal capacity of the person who performed the act.\n",
      "Exception 2: Only the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, their legal representative, successor, or an authorized person can rescind an act that is voidable due to mistakes, fraud, or duress.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 121 is that an act that has been rescinded is deemed void ab initio. This means that if an act or decision is later reversed or canceled, it is treated as though it never had legal effect from the beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no explicit exceptions to this rule in Article 121. However, there may be situations where the application of this principle could raise complex legal questions or lead to unintended consequences. For example, if an act that has been rescinded involved transfers of property or other transactions that relied on its validity, the retroactive voiding of the act could create issues of ownership or liability that would need to be resolved through further legal proceedings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, however, the principle embodied in Article 121 is considered important for maintaining the integrity and reliability of legal decisions and ensuring that individuals and organizations cannot benefit from actions that have been found to be invalid or unlawful.\n",
      "The article can be analyzed into three main premises:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. Paragraph (1): Obligation to restore to the original state when receiving payment or delivery based on a void act.\n",
      "  2. Paragraph (2): Exception to paragraph (1) for persons who receive payment or delivery based on a void gratuitous act and do not know the act is void.\n",
      "  3. Paragraph (3): Exception to paragraph (1) for persons without mental capacity or qualified legal capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the article outlines the general rule for restoring the parties to their original state in cases where payment or delivery has been made based on a void act, but also provides exceptions for situations where the recipient was unaware of the void nature of the act or lacked the necessary mental capacity to understand it.\n",
      "Main Premise: A voidable act may not be rescinded after the person prescribed in Article 120 ratifies it.\n",
      "Exception to Main Premise:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * The article does not specify any exceptions to the main premise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the structure of the rule is as follows:\n",
      "If an act is voidable and the person prescribed in Article 120 has ratified it, then the act cannot be rescinded. There are no exceptions to this rule.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 123 is that in order to make an act void or ratified, the intention to do so must be manifested to the counterparty.\n",
      "There are no explicit exceptions mentioned in this article. However, it can be inferred that there may be situations where the counterparty cannot be identified or reached, in which case the act may still be declared void or ratified through other means, such as through legal proceedings.\n",
      "Additionally, the article does not specify who has the power to manifest the intention to void or ratify the act. It is possible that different jurisdictions may have different rules regarding this matter. For example, in some cases, the party seeking to void or ratify the act may need to obtain authorization from a court or other competent authority before doing so.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 124 is that the ratification of a voidable act only becomes effective if it is made after the circumstances that made the act voidable cease to exist and the person ratifying the act becomes aware of the right to rescind it.\n",
      "However, there are two exceptions to this rule:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. If a legal representative or a curator or assistant of a person with qualified legal capacity ratifies the act, then the ratification does not need to be made after the circumstances that made the act voidable cease to exist.\n",
      "  2. If a person with qualified legal capacity (excluding an adult ward) makes the ratification with the consent of a legal representative, curator or assistant, then the ratification also does not need to be made after the circumstances that made the act voidable cease to exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, these exceptions allow for ratifications to be made even if the circumstances that made the act voidable still exist, as long as certain conditions are met.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 125 is that if any of the listed events occur with respect to a voidable act, then the act is deemed to have been ratified. This means that the act is treated as though it was valid and legally binding, even if it was originally invalid or questionable.\n",
      "There is one exception to this rule, which is that the act will not be deemed ratified if an objection is reserved. This means that if someone objects to the validity of the act before or after the listed events occur, then the act will not be considered ratified and may still be challenged in court.\n",
      "Overall, Article 125 establishes a framework for determining when a voidable act can be considered valid and legally binding, based on certain actions that take place related to the act. The exception ensures that people have the opportunity to challenge the validity of the act if they believe it is invalid or questionable.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 126 is that the right to rescind an act is extinguished by the operation of the prescription if it is not exercised within five years from the time when it becomes possible to ratify the act.\n",
      "The exception to this rule is that the same applies if 20 years have passed from the time of the act. This means that even if the right to rescind the act has not been exercised within five years from the time it became possible to ratify the act, the right will still be extinguished if 20 years have passed from the time of the act.\n",
      "In summary, the article establishes a five-year time limit for exercising the right to rescind an act, but also provides an exception to this time limit if 20 years have already passed since the act was performed.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 127 is that the effectiveness of a juridical act can be conditioned on certain events. The article then sets out two different types of conditions that can affect the effectiveness of a juridical act: conditions precedent and conditions subsequent.\n",
      "Conditions precedent refer to events that must occur before a juridical act can become effective. Under paragraph 1, if a juridical act is subject to a condition precedent, it will only become effective once that condition has been fulfilled. For example, if a contract specifies that it will only come into effect once a particular payment has been made, the contract will not be binding until the payment has been received.\n",
      "Conditions subsequent, on the other hand, refer to events that may cause a juridical act to cease being effective after it has already taken effect. Paragraph 2 provides that if a juridical act is subject to a condition subsequent, it will no longer be effective once that condition has been fulfilled. For instance, if a trust agreement specifies that it will terminate if a certain event occurs, such as the death of the beneficiary, the trust will cease to exist once that event takes place.\n",
      "Paragraph 3 introduces an exception to this general rule by allowing parties to express their intention for the effects of a juridical act to be retroactive. This means that the effects of the juridical act can be made to apply from a date earlier than the time at which the condition was fulfilled. For example, if a party wishes to transfer ownership of property as soon as a certain condition is met but wants the transfer to take effect from a date prior to the fulfillment of the condition, they can include a clause expressing this intention in the juridical act. In such cases, the intention expressed in the juridical act will prevail over the default rules set out in paragraphs 1 and 2.\n",
      "Main Premise: A party to a juridical act that is subject to a condition should not prejudice the other party's interests.\n",
      "Exception 1: If it is uncertain whether or not the condition will be fulfilled, then the party to the juridical act can still protect their own interests without prejudice to the other party's interests.\n",
      "Exception 2: However, if fulfilling the condition would result in the other party benefiting from the juridical act, then the party to the juridical act cannot prejudice the other party's interests by taking actions that prevent the fulfillment of the condition.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 129 is that even if it is uncertain whether a condition will be fulfilled, certain actions related to the rights and obligations of the party concerned can still be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * The first action mentioned is \"disposing\" of the rights and obligations. This could refer to transferring them to another party or otherwise altering their status.\n",
      "  * The second action is \"preserving\" the rights and obligations. This could involve taking steps to maintain the current state of affairs until the condition is fulfilled or resolved.\n",
      "  * The third action is providing \"security\" for the rights and obligations. This could include putting up collateral or insurance to protect against potential losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no explicit exceptions listed in this article, but it does use the phrase \"in accordance with the general provisions.\" This suggests that other laws or regulations may apply in specific circumstances and limit or modify the actions that can be taken under this provision.\n",
      "The two rules in Article 130 address situations where one party to a contract takes actions that interfere with the fulfillment of a condition specified in that contract.\n",
      "Main Premise: The first sentence states that if a party \"intentionally prevents the fulfillment of that condition,\" then the other party may consider the condition as having been fulfilled. This means that even though the condition was not actually met, the affected party can still enforce their rights under the contract as if it had been met.\n",
      "Exception to Main Premise: The second sentence introduces an exception to this main premise. It states that if a party \"wrongfully has that condition fulfilled,\" meaning they take affirmative steps to bring about the fulfillment of the condition despite not being entitled to do so, then the other party may consider the condition as not having been fulfilled. In other words, the fact that the condition was fulfilled does not necessarily mean that the affected party is now required to fulfill its obligations under the contract.\n",
      "Overall, these rules aim to prevent parties from taking unfair advantage of conditions in a contract by interfering with their fulfillment or by bringing them about through wrongful means. By allowing the counterparty to treat the condition as either fulfilled or not fulfilled depending on the circumstances, the rules seek to ensure that both parties act in good faith and that the terms of the contract are enforced fairly.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 131 is that the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of a condition affects the validity of a juridical act.\n",
      "The first paragraph states that if a condition precedent (a condition that must be fulfilled before a juridical act can take effect) has already been fulfilled at the time of the juridical act, then the juridical act is considered unconditional. On the other hand, if a condition subsequent (a condition that may trigger the termination or modification of a juridical act after it has taken effect) has already been fulfilled, then the juridical act is void.\n",
      "The second paragraph states that if it has already been established at the time of the juridical act that a condition precedent will not be fulfilled, then the juridical act is void. If a condition subsequent will not be fulfilled, then the juridical act is considered unconditional.\n",
      "The third paragraph clarifies that in both cases, the provisions of Article 128 and Article 129 apply mutatis mutandis (with necessary modifications) until the relevant party becomes aware that the condition has been or has not been fulfilled. This means that even if a condition has already been fulfilled or established as unfulfillable, the effects of the juridical act may still be subject to certain limitations or requirements until the relevant parties have become aware of the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of the condition.\n",
      "The structure of Article 132 can be analyzed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Main Premise: A juridical act subject to an unlawful condition is void.\n",
      "    * This means that if a legal act (such as a contract or a will) is conditioned on something that is illegal or against public policy, then the entire act is invalid and has no legal effect.\n",
      "  * Exception 1: The same applies to a juridical act subject to the condition that an unlawful act not be performed.\n",
      "    * This exception extends the main premise to cover situations where a legal act is conditioned on the non-performance of an unlawful act. For example, if a contract requires one party to refrain from committing a crime, then the contract would be void if the crime is committed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Article 132 establishes that any legal act that is conditioned on an unlawful act or the non-performance of an unlawful act is void and has no legal effect.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 133 is that a juridical act (a legal act or transaction) that is subject to an impossible condition is void. This means that if the condition cannot be fulfilled, then the entire juridical act is invalid and has no legal effect.\n",
      "However, there is an exception to this rule in the case of a juridical act that is subject to an impossible condition subsequent. In other words, if the condition is only supposed to take effect after the juridical act has already taken place, then the juridical act itself remains valid even if the condition turns out to be impossible. The reason for this is that the condition subsequent does not affect the validity of the original juridical act, but rather only determines its consequences.\n",
      "For example, suppose a contract is made in which Party A agrees to pay Party B a sum of money if a certain event occurs within one year. If the event turns out to be impossible to occur (e.g., because it depends on the actions of a third party who refuses to cooperate), then the condition precedent is impossible and the contract would be void under Article 133(1). However, if the same contract were structured as a sale with a clause stipulating that Party A could get their money back if the event did not occur within one year, then the condition subsequent would be impossible but the sale itself would remain valid under Article 133(2).\n",
      "In summary, Article 133 establishes a general principle that juridical acts subject to impossible conditions are void, but allows for an exception in cases where the condition is subsequent to the juridical act itself.\n",
      "Main Premise: A juridical act subject to a condition precedent is void.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 1: If the condition is dependent only upon the intention of the obligor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main premise states that a juridical act (a legal act or agreement) that is conditional upon something that must happen before it takes effect is void (invalid). This means that if there is a condition that must be met before the agreement can become legally binding, and that condition does not occur, then the agreement is not valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is an exception to this rule. If the condition precedent is dependent solely on the intention of the obligor (the person who is obligated by the agreement), then the agreement may still be considered valid even if the condition is not met. This means that if the obligor decides not to fulfill the condition for reasons outside of their control, the agreement would still be enforceable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while a juridical act subject to a condition precedent is generally void, if the condition is dependent only upon the intention of the obligor, then the agreement may still be considered valid.\n",
      "The main premise in Article 135 states that if a specific time has been assigned for a juridical act, then it cannot be performed or demanded before that specified time arrives. In other words, the performance of the juridical act is restricted until the designated time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 1: The first part of this rule does not apply when there are circumstances that prevent the timely execution of the juridical act, such as force majeure events like natural disasters or legal impediments that temporarily hinder its fulfillment. In these exceptional cases, even though the appointed time has arrived, the performance of the juridical act may still not be possible or required.\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise (2): Additionally, Article 135 specifies that if an expiration time has been assigned to a juridical act, then it will expire once that assigned time arrives. This means that after the specified expiration time, the juridical act can no longer be performed or enforced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 2: However, there might be situations where the expiration time has passed, but the parties involved have agreed to extend or renew the juridical act before it expired. In such cases, the juridical act may continue beyond the original expiration time based on the new agreement between the parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Article 135 establishes the general principle that juridical acts must adhere to their assigned times for commencement and expiration. Exceptions to these rules can occur when unforeseen circumstances prevent timely execution or when the parties agree to modify the deadlines.\n",
      "Main Premise: The time stipulation is presumed to be provided for the benefit of the obligor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception to Main Premise: The benefit of time stipulation may be waived.\n",
      "* However, this exception cannot prejudice the interest of the counterparty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In simpler terms:\n",
      "\n",
      "The default assumption is that a time clause in a contract benefits the party who has to fulfill the obligation (the obligor). For example, if a loan agreement states that the borrower must repay the debt within a certain timeframe, the borrower is assumed to benefit from having that specific period to pay back the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's possible for the obligor to give up their right to the benefit of the time stipulation, meaning they could agree to repay the debt earlier than originally specified in the contract. But this exception is subject to an important condition: the waiver cannot harm the interests of the other party involved (the counterparty), such as the lender's ability to recover the loaned amount. This ensures that both parties' rights and interests are protected throughout the contractual relationship.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 137 is that an obligor (a person who owes something to another) cannot claim the benefit of a time stipulation in certain circumstances.\n",
      "A time stipulation refers to a provision in a contract or agreement that specifies when a payment or other obligation must be fulfilled. For example, a loan agreement might include a clause stating that the borrower must make all payments by a certain date.\n",
      "The exception to this general rule is listed in three sub-clauses:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. If the obligor becomes subject to the order commencing bankruptcy proceedings, they cannot claim the benefit of a time stipulation. This means that even if the obligor and creditor agreed on a specific timeline for repayment, the bankruptcy proceedings take precedence, and the creditor can demand immediate payment.\n",
      "  2. If the obligor loses, damages, or diminishes the security provided for the debt, they cannot claim the benefit of a time stipulation. Security refers to any collateral or guarantee provided by the obligor to ensure that the debt will be paid. If the obligor damages or loses this security, the creditor may require immediate payment regardless of any time stipulations in the original agreement.\n",
      "  3. If the obligor fails to provide security when they have an obligation to do so, they cannot claim the benefit of a time stipulation. This means that if the obligor was required to provide collateral or guarantees as part of the agreement but failed to do so, the creditor can demand immediate payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these exceptions aim to protect creditors from being disadvantaged by an obligor's financial difficulties or irresponsible behavior. They ensure that creditors can recover their debts promptly if necessary, even if the original agreement included time stipulations.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 138 is that the method of computation of a period of time is generally governed by the provisions of the Chapter. This means that when calculating a specific period of time, the rules outlined in the Chapter will apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are three exceptions to this general rule:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The first exception is if another law or regulation provides a different method of computation for that particular period of time. In such cases, the provisions of that law or regulation will prevail over the provisions of the Chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The second exception is if a judicial order specifies a different method of computation for that particular period of time. In such cases, the provisions of the judicial order will prevail over the provisions of the Chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The third exception is if a relevant juridical act (such as a contract or agreement) provides a different method of computation for that particular period of time. In such cases, the provisions of the juridical act will prevail over the provisions of the Chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Article 138 establishes a default method for computing periods of time, but allows for flexibility in certain circumstances where other laws, regulations, judicial orders, or juridical acts provide alternative methods.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 139 is that when a period is specified in hours, it begins immediately at the stated time. This means that if a task or activity has a specific duration given in hours, then the clock starts ticking as soon as the designated starting time arrives.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no explicit exception mentioned in this article. However, there may be situations where extenuating circumstances prevent the start of the period at the specified time. In such cases, it would be up to the relevant authority or governing body to determine how to handle the situation and whether any adjustments need to be made to the starting time or duration of the period. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if severe weather conditions cause a delay in starting a construction project that has a specified timeframe in hours, the project team might request an extension to the deadline or adjust the schedule accordingly. Similarly, if technical difficulties arise during a software development project with a set timeline, the team might need to negotiate additional time to resolve the issues without impacting the overall quality of the final product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while there is no specific exception outlined in Article 139, unforeseen circumstances can sometimes require flexibility and adaptation to ensure fairness and feasibility in applying the rule.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 140 is that when a period is provided for in days, weeks, months, or years, the first day of the period is not included in the computation. This means that if a deadline is given in terms of a certain number of days, weeks, months, or years, the first day of that period should not be counted towards the total number of days, weeks, months, or years.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is an exception to this rule. The exception states that the first day of the period should be included in the computation when the period commences at twelve midnight. This means that if a deadline starts at exactly midnight, then the first day of the period should be counted towards the total number of days, weeks, months, or years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the main premise of Article 140 is that the first day of a period is generally not included in the computation, but there is an exception to this rule when the period starts at midnight.\n",
      "The sentence is structured as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Main premise: \"In the case referred to in the preceding Article, the period expires at the end of the last day.\"\n",
      "- Exception: None provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main premise states that if a case is being referred to in the preceding article, then the period (presumably referring to a deadline or time limit) will expire at the end of the last day. There is no exception provided, which means that this rule applies universally to all cases that meet the criteria specified in the preceding article.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 142 is that if the last day of a period falls on a Sunday, a holiday as provided in the Act on National Holidays, or any other holiday when it is customary not to do business on the relevant day, then the period will expire on the immediately following day.\n",
      "The exception to this rule is that if the last day of the period does not fall on a Sunday, a holiday as provided in the Act on National Holidays, or any other holiday when it is customary not to do business on the relevant day, then the period will expire on the originally scheduled last day, even if that day is a holiday. In other words, if the last day of the period is a holiday but it is not a Sunday or another type of holiday when it is customary not to do business, then the period will still expire on that day.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 143 is that when calculating periods specified in weeks, months, or years, they should be calculated according to the calendar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 1: If a period does not start at the beginning of the week, month, or year, it will expire on the day immediately preceding the day that corresponds to the commencement day in the last week, month, or year. For example, if a contract specifies a six-month period starting from March 15th, it will end on September 14th (the day before September 15th).\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 2: If the last month of the period does not have a corresponding day, the period will expire on the last day of that month. For example, if a one-year contract starts on February 28th, it will end on February 28th of the following year (since February may not have 29 days).\n",
      "The given statement, \"Article 144 The prescription is retroactive to the commencement day,\" appears to be a straightforward declarative sentence with no explicit exceptions mentioned. \n",

      "- Article 144 refers to a legal provision or regulation.\n",
      "- The prescription (presumably referring to a statute of limitations) is retroactive, meaning it applies to events that occurred before its enactment.\n",
      "- The retroactivity of the prescription takes effect from the commencement day, which is likely the date when the law or regulation came into force.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception:\n",
      "There is no explicit exception provided in the given statement. However, in general, laws and regulations may have exceptions or exemptions for certain situations or categories of individuals. Without further context or information about Article 144, it is unclear whether any such exceptions exist.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 145 is that the court cannot make a judicial decision based on prescription unless a party invokes it.\n",
      "Exception 1: In the case of extinctive prescription, the exception to this rule is that a guarantor, third-party collateral provider, third-party acquirer, or any other person with a legitimate interest in the extinction of a right can invoke prescription.\n",
      "In summary, Article 145 states that a court cannot rely on prescription to make a judicial decision unless a party with an interest in the matter specifically invokes it. However, there is an exception for cases of extinctive prescription where certain third parties can invoke prescription even if they were not originally involved in the dispute.\n",
      "The main premise of this rule is that the benefits of the prescription cannot be waived in advance. In other words, a person cannot agree to give up their right to certain benefits before they become entitled to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no explicit exceptions to this rule stated in Article 146. However, it's possible that there could be situations where a court or regulatory body might interpret an exception to exist. For example, if there is a clear public interest in allowing a waiver of prescription benefits in a particular case, a court might decide that the rule should not apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, though, the rule as stated is quite broad and does not allow for many exceptions. It emphasizes the importance of protecting individuals' rights to access the full benefits of prescriptions, even if they might want to waive those rights in advance for some reason.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 147 of the Japanese Civil Code is that the period of prescription, or the legal deadline for exercising a right, can be extended under certain circumstances.\n",
      "The first exception listed in paragraph (1) is \"demand by litigation,\" which means that if a person initiates legal proceedings to enforce their rights, the period of prescription will not expire until the legal proceedings are concluded.\n",
      "The second exception is \"demand for payment,\" which refers to a written request for payment made by a creditor to a debtor. If such a demand is made, the period of prescription will not expire until the demand is fulfilled or withdrawn.\n",
      "The third exception is \"settlement referred to in Article 275, paragraph (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure or mediation under the Civil Conciliation Act or the Domestic Relations Case Procedure Act.\" This exception covers situations where the parties reach an agreement through alternative dispute resolution methods, such as mediation or conciliation. If such an agreement is reached, the period of prescription will not expire until the agreement is fulfilled or withdrawn.\n",
      "The fourth exception is \"participation in bankruptcy proceeding, rehabilitation proceeding or reorganization proceeding.\" If a person participates in one of these types of insolvency proceedings, the period of prescription will not expire until the proceedings are completed or the person withdraws from them.\n",
      "Paragraph (2) specifies that if a right is determined by a final and binding judgment or something that has the same effect, a new period of prescription will commence to run at the time when the grounds set forth in the exceptions of paragraph (1) cease to exist. This means that even if the period of prescription was extended due to one of the exceptions, it may start running again once the exception no longer applies.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 148 is that if certain specified grounds exist, the prescription period (the time limit within which legal action must be taken) does not expire until those grounds cease to exist.\n",
      "There are four exceptions listed in Paragraph (1), which are:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Compulsory execution\n",
      "  * Enforcement of a security right\n",
      "  * Auction under the rules of an auction for the enforcement of a security right prescribed in Article 195 of the Civil Execution Act\n",
      "  * Asset disclosure procedure prescribed in Article 196 of the Civil Execution Act\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, if any of these exceptions occur, the prescription period will continue running and will not expire until the exception no longer applies.\n",
      "Paragraph (2) specifies that when the grounds mentioned in Paragraph (1) cease to exist, a new period of prescription will commence from that point forward. However, there is an exception to this general rule: if the grounds cease to exist because a petition was withdrawn or rescinded due to non-compliance with the law, then a new period of prescription will not start to run again.\n",
      "Therefore, the overall structure of Article 148 can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "Main Premise: If certain specified grounds exist, the prescription period does not expire until those grounds cease to exist.\n",
      "Exception 1: Compulsory execution\n",
      "Exception 2: Enforcement of a security right\n",
      "Exception 3: Auction under the rules of an auction for the enforcement of a security right\n",
      "Exception 4: Asset disclosure procedure\n",
      "Sub-exception: If the grounds cease to exist due to the withdrawal of a petition or the rescission of a petition for failure to comply with the provisions of the law, a new period of prescription does not commence.\n",
      "The main premise in Article 149 is that the prescription period, which refers to the time limit for filing a lawsuit or taking other legal action, will be extended under certain circumstances. Specifically, if any of the two grounds listed in the article exist, the prescription period will not expire until six months have passed from the time when the ground ceases to exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first exception listed in the article is \"provisional seizure.\" This refers to a situation where a court orders the temporary seizure of property or assets to prevent them from being moved, hidden, or otherwise disposed of before a judgment is rendered. If a provisional seizure is in place, the prescription period will be extended until six months after the seizure is lifted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second exception listed in the article is \"provisional disposition.\" This refers to a situation where a court orders a temporary measure to maintain the status quo or prevent imminent harm before a final decision is made. If a provisional disposition is in effect, the prescription period will be extended until six months after the disposition is lifted.\n",
      "\n",
      "In both cases, the exceptions apply only as long as the relevant ground continues to exist. Once the ground ceases to exist, the prescription period will resume and begin counting down again, with the extension having been applied. The purpose of these exceptions is to ensure that individuals have sufficient time to take legal action without being unduly hindered by temporary measures that may impact their ability to do so.\n",
      "The main premise in Article 150 states that if a demand is made, the prescription period (the period within which legal action must be taken) will not expire until six months have passed since the time of the demand.\n",
      "The exception to this rule is stated in the second paragraph, which specifies that if a second demand is made during the postponement of the expiration of the prescription period granted on the grounds of the first demand, it will not have the effect of further postponing the expiration of the prescription period under the provisions of the preceding paragraph. In other words, making a second demand during the extended period granted due to the first demand will not grant any additional extension beyond the original six-month period.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 151 is that if an agreement is made in writing concerning a right, the prescription period (the time limit for exercising a legal claim) does not expire until certain conditions are met.\n",
      "Exception 1: The first exception states that if the period during which the parties are to hold a discussion is specified by the agreement and is less than one year, the prescription period expires when that period has ended.\n",
      "Exception 2: The second exception states that if one party notifies the other party in writing of their refusal to continue the discussion, the prescription period expires when six months have passed from the time of the notice.\n",
      "Exception 3: The third exception states that if an agreement referred to in the first paragraph is made during the postponement of expiry of the prescription period granted on the ground of a demand, it does not have the effect of postponing the expiration of the prescription period.\n",
      "Exception 4: The fourth exception states that if an agreement referred to in the first paragraph is made by means of an electronic or magnetic record, it is deemed to have been made in writing and the provisions of the previous three paragraphs apply to it.\n",
      "Exception 5: The fifth exception states that the provisions of the previous paragraph also apply mutatis mutandis to the notice referred to in paragraph (1)(iii).\n",
      "The main premise of Article 152 is that when a right is acknowledged, a new period of prescription commences to run at the time of the acknowledgment.\n",
      "The exception to this rule is stated in paragraph (2), which specifies that with respect to the disposition of the right of the other party, an acknowledgment referred to in paragraph (1) does not require unlimited capacity to act or authority.\n",
      "In other words, if someone acknowledges a right, it will restart the clock on the statute of limitations for that right, but this acknowledgement does not necessarily require the person making the acknowledgement to have full legal capacity or authorization to do so. This exception ensures that people who may not have full legal capacity or authority can still acknowledge rights and restart the statute of limitations without facing unnecessary barriers.\n",
      "The structure of Article 153 can be analyzed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "- The postponement or renewal of a prescription period is effective only between certain parties and their successors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 1 (Paragraph 1):\n",
      "- This exception applies when the postponement or renewal is based on the provisions of Article 147 or Article 148.\n",
      "- In this case, the effectiveness of the postponement or renewal is limited to the parties who have grounds for such postponement or renewal and their successors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 2 (Paragraph 2):\n",
      "- This exception applies when the postponement is based on the provisions of Articles 149 through 151.\n",
      "- In this case, the effectiveness of the postponement is limited to the parties who have grounds for such postponement and their successors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 3 (Paragraph 3):\n",
      "- This exception applies when the renewal is based on the provisions of the preceding article.\n",
      "- In this case, the effectiveness of the renewal is limited to the parties who have grounds for such renewal and their successors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the main premise of Article 153 is that the postponement or renewal of a prescription period is not automatically effective for all parties involved, but rather depends on specific circumstances and the existence of certain grounds. The exceptions provide further limitations on the scope of this effectiveness depending on the specific provisions being applied.\n",
      "The structure of this article can be analyzed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "If the procedure regarding any of the grounds set forth in the items of Article 148, paragraph (1) or the items of Article 149 is not carried out in relation to a person that is to receive the benefit of prescription, it does not have an effect of postponement of expiry of prescription period or renewal of prescription period under the provisions of Article 148 or Article 149.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception to the Main Premise:\n",
      "However, this lack of effect on the postponement or renewal of the prescription period applies only if the person who is supposed to receive the benefit of prescription has not been notified of the non-completion of the procedure. In other words, if the person is notified about the incomplete procedure, then the provisions of Article 148 or Article 149 may still apply, allowing for the postponement or renewal of the prescription period.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 158 is that the period of prescription for minors or adult wards does not expire if they do not have a legal representative during the six months preceding its expiration. In other words, if a minor or adult ward does not have someone to act on their behalf during the final six months of the prescription period, then the period of prescription will be extended.\n",
      "The first exception to this rule is found in paragraph (1), which states that the period of prescription will not expire until six months after the minor or adult ward gains the capacity to act or a legal representative assumes the position. This means that if a minor or adult ward becomes capable of acting on their own behalf or obtains a new legal representative within the original six-month period, then the period of prescription will be extended for an additional six months.\n",
      "The second exception is found in paragraph (2), which applies specifically to cases where the minor or adult ward has rights vis-à-vis their parent, guardian, or other person managing their property. In such cases, the period of prescription will not expire until six months after the minor or adult ward gains the capacity to act or a new legal representative assumes the position. This exception ensures that the rights of the minor or adult ward are protected even if their parent or guardian is responsible for managing their property.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 159 is that the prescription period for rights that either spouse has against the other does not expire until six months after the marriage is dissolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no explicit exception mentioned in this article. However, it can be inferred that the six-month prescriptive period only applies to rights that arise during the婚姻 and not to any rights that may exist independently of the marriage. Additionally, the article does not specify what types of rights are covered by this provision, leaving it open to interpretation by courts and legal authorities.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 160 is that the prescription period for an estate does not expire until six months have passed from a specific event.\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. The first exception is when the heir is identified. This means that if an heir is identified before the expiration of the prescription period, the period will be extended for another six months from the date of identification.\n",
      "  2. The second exception is when an administrator is appointed. If an administrator is appointed before the expiration of the prescription period, the period will be extended for another six months from the date of appointment.\n",
      "  3. The third exception is when commencement of bankruptcy proceedings is ordered. If bankruptcy proceedings are initiated before the expiration of the prescription period, the period will be extended for another six months from the date of the order.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the main premise of Article 160 is that the prescription period for an estate will be extended for six months in certain circumstances related to the identification of heirs, appointment of administrators, or initiation of bankruptcy proceedings.\n",
      "The structure of this article can be analyzed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise:\n",
      "- If it is impossible to carry out the procedure regarding any of the grounds set forth in the items of Article 147, paragraph (1) or the items of Article 148, paragraph (1)\n",
      "- upon the expiration of the period of prescription\n",
      "- due to a natural disaster or other unavoidable grave incident\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception to the Main Premise:\n",
      "- The prescription period does not expire until three months have passed from the time when that impediment ceases to exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "This article states that if it becomes impossible to carry out the procedures related to specific grounds mentioned in Articles 147 and 148 due to a natural disaster or another unavoidable incident after the prescribed period has expired, the expiration of the prescription period will be extended. Instead of expiring immediately, the period of prescription will be prolonged for an additional three months from the time when the impediment no longer exists. In essence, this provision allows for more time to complete the necessary procedures in cases where unforeseen circumstances prevent their timely completion.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 162 is that a person can acquire ownership of someone else's property through peaceful and open possession for a certain period of time.\n",
      "The first rule states that a person who possesses the property of another for 20 years peacefully and openly with the intention to own it acquires ownership thereof. This means that if someone has possessed a piece of property for 20 years without any interference from the true owner, they will become the legal owner of the property.\n",
      "However, there is an exception to this rule stated in the second paragraph. If a person possesses the property of another for only 10 years peacefully and openly with the intention to own it, they can still acquire ownership of the property as long as they were acting in good faith and were not negligent at the time when the possession started. This means that if someone honestly believed they had a right to possess the property and acted reasonably in doing so, they may be able to acquire ownership even if they have not possessed the property for the full 20-year period.\n",
      "The main premise of this article is that a person who exercises a property right other than ownership peacefully and openly with the intention to do so on their own behalf can acquire that right after a certain period of time has passed.\n",
      "There are two possible periods of time mentioned in the article: 20 years or 10 years. The specific period of time that applies will depend on the circumstances of the case, as determined by the \"distinction provided for in the preceding Article.\"\n",
      "It is not clear from the text what this distinction refers to, but it suggests that there may be some factor that determines whether the 20-year or 10-year period applies.\n",
      "There does not appear to be any explicit exceptions to this rule in the text. However, it is worth noting that the acquisition of a property right through the exercise of peaceful and open use over a long period of time is known as adverse possession. In many jurisdictions, there are limitations and requirements that must be met in order for adverse possession to occur, such as a requirement that the person claiming the right had a good faith belief that they were entitled to it. It is possible that such limitations and requirements would also apply in the context of this article.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 164 is that the prescription period specified in Article 162 can be renewed under certain circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 1: The prescription period will not be renewed if the possessor discontinues possession voluntarily. This means that if the possessor gives up their right to possess something on their own accord, they cannot restart the prescription period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception 2: The prescription period will also not be renewed if the possessor is deprived of possession by another person. This means that if someone else takes away the possessor's right to possess something through force or other legal means, the prescriptive period cannot be restarted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Article 164 sets out two exceptions to the general rule that the prescription period can be renewed, which must be taken into account when determining whether the prescriptive period has been met.\n",
      "The sentence \"Article 165 The provisions of the preceding Article apply mutatis mutandis to the case under Article 163\" is a legal statement that refers to two articles in a document or law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Premise: The provisions of the preceding Article apply mutatis mutandis.\n",
      "This means that the rules or regulations stated in the previous article can be applied to another situation or context with necessary modifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception: The case under Article 163.\n",
      "This exception specifies that the above-mentioned provision applies to the scenario described in Article 163. Therefore, any adjustments or changes required when applying the provisions of the preceding article should be made considering the circumstances outlined in Article 163. \n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the sentence implies that the provisions of the preceding article will be applicable to the case under Article 163, but with necessary modifications, taking into account the specific conditions outlined in Article 163.\n",
      "The article contains three main premises related to the extinction of claims and property rights due to prescription.\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. Main Premise 1: Claims are extinguished by prescription if the obligee fails to exercise the right within a specified time limit.\n",
      "    * Exception: This provision does not apply to acquisitive prescription for the benefit of a third party who possesses the subject matter of a right with a time of commencement or a right subject to a condition precedent.\n",
      "  2. Main Premise 2: Property rights other than ownership are extinguished by prescription if not exercised within 20 years from the time when they became exercisable.\n",
      "    * No exception is explicitly mentioned in this premise.\n",
      "  3. Main Premise 3: The provisions of the first two premises do not prevent the renewal of the prescription period through acknowledgment by the possessor at any time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each main premise outlines a specific scenario under which a claim or property right can be extinguished due to prescription. The exceptions in Main Premises 1 and 3 provide additional details on the circumstances in which these provisions may not apply.\n",
      "The main premise of this legal provision is that certain provisions in the preceding article apply to the extinctive prescription of a claim for damages arising from the death or injury of persons. Specifically, the provision mentions paragraph (1), item (ii) of the preceding article.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is an exception to this rule. The exception states that when applying these provisions to the extinctive prescription of a claim for damages arising from the death or injury of persons, the phrase \"10 years\" in item (ii) of the preceding article should be replaced with \"20 years\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the main premise of the provision is that certain provisions of the preceding article apply to the extinctive prescription of a claim for damages arising from the death or injury of persons, while the exception modifies the application of one specific provision within those provisions.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 168 is that claims for periodic payments can be extinguished by prescription under certain circumstances.\n",
      "Exception 1: If the obligee fails to exercise their right to receive each individual payment, such as money, within 10 years of becoming aware that they have the right to do so, then the claim will be extinguished. This exception applies to situations where the obligee has knowledge of their rights but does not act on them in a timely manner.\n",
      "Exception 2: If the obligee fails to exercise their right to receive each individual payment within 20 years of when the payment became due and payable, then the claim will be extinguished. This exception applies to situations where the obligee may not have been aware of their rights or may have delayed exercising them for some reason.\n",
      "However, there is an exception to these exceptions: The obligee can prevent the extinguishment of their claim by requiring the obligor to issue a written acknowledgement at any time during the prescription period. By obtaining this written acknowledgement, the obligee can renew the prescription period and avoid the extinguishment of their claim.\n",
      "The main premise of Article 169 is that the period of prescription for a right determined by a final and binding judgment or anything with the same effect is 10 years, even if a shorter period is provided for.\n",
      "The exception to this rule is stated in Paragraph (2), which specifies that the provision does not apply to a claim that is not yet due and payable at the time it is determined. In other words, if a claim is not yet matured or actionable, the 10-year prescription period will not apply.\n"
